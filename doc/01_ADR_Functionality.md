### Status  
Proposed


### Context  
We need to create a list of main functions to define business justification of first version of an application and decide what funcjonaiti should be canceled or suspended to further implementation in next releases.


### Decision  

A first brainstorm created a list of basic functions expectted to implement:
- Create a databases to contain at least datas like:
	- Profiles of animals (starting examples based on chinchilas: age, weight, size, food preferences etc.)

	- Profiles of Healtcare places (adress, geographic location, historical prices, ratings of individual personel) and vets of different specialisations (internist, ophthalmologist, dentist, surgeon etc.)
	- Different types of calendars (medical visits, bought info of food and feeding's periods, medicines dosages),
	- Keeping medical records recieved from vets in .pdf formats,
- Genetarinng static diagrams on button demand, like a chartsof weight and consumed amount of medicines,
- Creat stick notes kanboard to manage a feeding period per bought food,
- Sending visit notifications via at least one of: sms, whatsap, messanger, e-mail, discord,
- Printable notes and charts into pdf reports, 
- Synchronization into a google calendar,
- Basic API to consider a transfer od charts into Dash-plotly.

List todos suspended until next iterations of application: 
- Interactive dashboards,
- Implementation all of proposed notification methods, 
- Direct chat between users, without using animal's notes.
