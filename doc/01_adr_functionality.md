## To create a core functionality as a scope of Animals Healthcare Application project


### Date:Â 
`2023-06-04`


### Status  
In-building


### Context  
We need to create a list of main functions to define business justification of first version of an application and decide what functionality should be canceled or suspended to further implementation in next releases.


### Decision  

A first brainstorm created a list of basic functions expectted to implement:
- Create a databases to contain at least data like:
	- Profiles of animals (starting examples based on chinchilas: age, weight, size, food preferences etc.)
	- Profiles of users (not nessesery an owner),
	- Profiles of Healtcare places (address, geographic location, historical prices, ratings of individual personnel) and vets of different specialisations (internist, ophthalmologist, dentist, surgeon etc.)
	- Different types of calendars (medical visits, bought info of food and feeding's periods, medicines dosage),
	- Keeping medical records received from vets in .pdf formats,
- Generate static diagrams on button demand, like a charts of weight and consumed amount of medicines,
- Creat sticky notes kanboard to manage a feeding period per purchased food,
- Sending visit notifications via at least one of: sms, whatsap, messenger, e-mail, discord,
- Printable notes and charts into pdf reports, 
- Synchronization into a google calendar,
- Basic API to consider a transfer of charts into Dash-Plotly.

List to-do's suspended until next iterations of application:
- Interactive dashboards,
- Implementation all of proposed notification methods, 
- Direct chat between users, without using animal's notes.


### Consequences  
An effortful list of functionality has been created to exercise a building process of web applications. 
The demands have been divided into quickly attainable goals, leaving a basic draft of a further development.
