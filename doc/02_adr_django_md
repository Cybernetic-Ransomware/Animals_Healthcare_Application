## To choose a main web framework for project


### Date:Â 
`2023-06-05`


### Status  
Proposed


### Context  
We need to choose a main web framework technology to create a core of application.\
Considered technologies: 
- Django, 
- Flask,
- Dash Plotly.


### Decision  
Django was selected. The developer has the most recent experience and the desire to systematize knowledge.

Flask as a microframework could extend the time to the first working prototype.

Dash is a derivative framework for Flask with extensive features for generating interactive dashboards. 
This functionality has been postponed to a later stage of application development.


### Consequences  
Expected short time to prepare the first working prototype. 
Through good community support, pluggins supporting particular functionalities should be available (ORM, logging, api).


### Keywords
-   Django,
-   Flask, 
-   Dash Plotly,
-   web framework.
