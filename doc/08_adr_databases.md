## To choose DBMS


### Date: 
`2023-06-05`


### Status  
Proposed


### Context  
We need to choose a database for a specific task within the application.\
Considered DBMS: 
- [x] PostgreSQL,
- [ ] MS SQL,
- [ ] MySQL,
- [ ] SQLite,
- [ ] MongoDB,
- [ ] Redis,
- [ ] Firebird,
- [x] CouchDB.


### Decision  
Two databases have been selected for routing testing.

PostgreSQL - quick database creation and configuration with a good SQL interface. It has many use cases with Django.

CouchDB - native support for files as attachments. Non-relational database, intended for file storage only.


### Consequences  
In basic form database routing is required. 
The implementation should be quick, as the second database will be used only for storing attachment files.


### Keywords
-   DBMS,
-   database.
